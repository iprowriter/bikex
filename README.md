###  WELCOME
Thanks for your interest in this project. Here, you will learn how to run this project locally on your machine. 
It is important to mention that this project is already hosted on Heroku.

NB: The hosted version may require some time to fully load.



## HOW TO RUN THIS PROJECT LOCALLY ON YOUR MACHINE
This project folder is structured as follows: Bikex > bikeshop + bikeshop-backend
- Bikex is the root folder
- Bikeshop is the folder that contains all the files for the client side
- Bikeshop-backend is the folder that contains all the files and logic for the backend.


Follow the following steps to run this project:

# Step 1: Install node modules on the root folder
on the root folder (bikex) run `npm install`. This will install all the packages and dependencies used for this project.

# Step 2: Install node modules again on the client (frontend) folder
You will still need to install another node_modules on the clientside. Therefore, go to or cd into 'bikeshop folder' and run `npm install`

# Step 3:  Start the Server
Now that you have installed all the necessary modules, packages, and dependencies, it is time to start the server and run the project.

Go back to the root folder (bikex) and run the following command:
`node bikeshop-backend/server`
This  will start the development server on port 5000

# Step 4: Start the Client Side  (React)
Go  back  or cd  into the bikeshop folder and run the following command:
`npm  start`

Note:  Both backend and frontend must be running at the same time on different servers.
An alternative to Step 3 and 4 is to run `npm run dev` on the root folder (Bikex) to start both frontend and backend up at the same time.

# Step 5: Visit Your Browser
If all works well, the project will start on [http://localhost:3000] (give it time)

Please note: It could be that some of the dependencies used for this project are deprecated by the time you use the project. Please have this mind. Thank you.
